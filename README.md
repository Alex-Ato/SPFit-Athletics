In this project Alex and Jorge re-worked a website from Sabrina, Alex's friend. 
Jorge handled the first half of the index, as well as the leggings site and the video portion of the gallery site.
Alex Handled the latter half of the index, the shirts site, and the photo part on the gallery Site.

This site was handled with HTML CSS and Bootstrap

This site focused on using what minimal content we were given and expanding it out through various features within the site.
We also embedded instagram photos and captured some videos to thus create a Gallery site.
